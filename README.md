Code Organization:
The code is organized into three main parts:
1.	Importing the requests library: The requests library is used to make HTTP requests to the Google Maps API.
2.	Defining the API key and location: The API key is used to authenticate with the Google Maps API, and the location is the specific location we want to query.
3.	Sending the request and processing the response: The code sends a GET request to the Google Maps API using the requests library and the specified parameters. The response is then parsed and the latitude and longitude are extracted from the JSON data. Finally, the extracted data is processed and printed to the console.

Data Processing Approach:
The code uses JSON parsing to extract the relevant information from the API response. JSON is a common data format for exchanging data between applications, and it is easy to parse using Python's built-in JSON module.
